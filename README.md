# Velux Binding

This binding integrates the <B>Velux</B> devices with help of a gateway, the <B>Velux Bridge KLF200</B>, which is able to control 200 actuators.
The Velux Binding interacts via the Velux Bridge with any [io-homecontrol](http://www.io-homecontrol.com/)-based
devices like window openers, shutters and others.

Based on the VELUX API this binding integrates <B>Velux</B> and other io-homecontrol devices directly into the openHAB, avoiding the necessity of any cloud-based mediation infrastructures. The complete home-automation will work even without any Internet connectivity.

For details about the features, see the following websites:

- [Velux](http://www.velux.com)
- [Velux API](http://www.velux.com/api/klf200)

## Overview

As the API is widely open, there are several use cases which are supported by the Bridge:
From the complete configuration of a set of io-homecontrol devices including registration, naming, grouping, crypto key setup and exchange, the definition of intended settings, so called scenes, up to the control of single devices, i.e. ```open window of bathroom up to 45%```.

The following areas are covered:

Advise: if you see a significant number of messages per day like

```
 communicate(): socket I/O failed continuously (x times).
```

please increase the parameters retries or/and timeoutMsecs.

For your convenience you'll see a log entry for the recognized configuration within the log file i.e.

## Discovery

Unfortunately there is no way to discover the Velux bridge itself within the local network. But after configuring the Velux Bridge, it is possible to discover all scenes and actuators like windows and rollershutters by the binding.

## Item Configuration

The Items of a Velux Bridge consists in general of a pair of mastertype and subtype definition.
In the appropriate items file, i.e. velux.items, this looks like

```
{ velux="thing=<Mastertype>;channel=<Subtype>" }
```

Optionally the subtype is enhanced with parameters like the appropriate name of the scene.

```
{ velux="thing=<Mastertype>;channel=<Subtype>#<Parameter>" }
```

| Mastertype    | Description                                                                      |

Notes:
(\*\*\*) The existence of this item triggers the continuous realtime status updates of any Velux item like shutters even if they are manually controlled by other controllers.

(\*\*\*\*) To enable a complete invertion of all parameter values (i.e. for Velux windows), add a trailing star to the eight-byte serial number. For an example,
see below at item `Velux DG Window Bathroom`.

(\*\*\*\*\*) Somfy devices does not provides a valid serial number to the Velux KLF200 gateway: The bridge reports a registration of the serial number 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00. Therefore the binding implements a fallback to allow an item specification with a actuator name instead of actuator serial number whenever such an invalid serial number occurs. For an example, see below at item `Velux OG Somfy Shutter`.


### Subtype Parameters

In case of the scene-related subtypes, action and silentMode, the specification of the related scene as parameters is necessary;

```
{ velux="thing=scene;channel=<Subtype>#<Parameter>" }
```

The subtype shutter requires an even pair of parameters, each defining the shutter level and the related scene:

```
{ velux="thing=brigde;channel=shutter#<Level1>,<Scene1>,<Level2>,<Scene2>" }
```

### Virtual shutter

As the bridge does not support a real rollershutter interaction, this binding provides a virtual rollershutter consisting of different scenes which set a specific shutter level. Therefore the item definition contains multiple pairs of rollershutter levels each followed by a scene name, which leads to this setting.

## More automation samples

At this point some interesting automation rules are included to demonstrate the power of this gateway to the io-homecontrol world.


### Closing windows after a period of time

Especially in the colder months, it is advisable to close the window after adequate ventilation. Therefore, automatic closing after one minute is good to save on heating costs.
However, to allow the case of intentional prolonged opening, an automatic closure is made only with the window fully open.

```
/*
 * Start of imports
 */

import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

/*
 * Start of rules
 */

rule "V_WINDOW_changed"
when
	Item V_WINDOW changed
then
	logInfo("rules.V_WINDOW",	"V_WINDOW_changes() called.")
	//
	// Get the sensor value
	//
	val Number windowState = V_WINDOW.state as DecimalType
	logWarn("rules.V_WINDOW", "Window state is "+windowState+".")
	if (windowState < 80) {
		if (windowState == 0) {
			logWarn("rules.V_WINDOW", "V-WINDOW changed to fully open.")

			var int interval = 1
	
        		createTimer(now.plusMinutes(interval)) [|
				logWarn("rules.V_WINDOW:event", "event-V_WINDOW(): setting V-WINDOW to 100.")
                		sendCommand(V_WINDOW,100)
				V_WINDOW.postUpdate(100)
    				logWarn("rules.V_WINDOW:event", "event-V_WINDOW done.")
        		]
    		} else {
			logWarn("rules.V_WINDOW", "V-WINDOW changed to partially open.")
		}
    	}
	//
	// Check type of item
	//
	logDebug("rules.V_WINDOW",	"V_WINDOW_changes finished.")
end

/*
 * end-of-rules/V_WINDOW.rules

```

## Debugging

For those who are interested in more detailed insight of the processing of this binding, a deeper look can be achieved by increased loglevel.

With Karaf you can use the following command sequence:

```
log:set TRACE org.openhab.binding.velux
log:tail
```

This, of course, is possible on command line with the commands:

```
% openhab-cli console log:set TRACE org.openhab.binding.velux 
% openhab-cli console log:tail org.openhab.binding.velux
```

On the other hand, if you prefer a textual configuration, you can append the logging definition with:

```
	<logger name="org.openhab.binding.velux" level="TRACE">
		<appender-ref ref="FILE" />
	</logger>
```

During startup of normal operations, there should be only some few messages within the logfile, like:

## Supported/Tested Firmware Revisions

The Velux Bridge in API version one (firmware version 0.1.1.*) allows activating a set of predefined actions, so called scenes. Therefore beside the bridge, only one main thing exists, the scene element. The next-generation firmware version two is not backward compatible, and does not provide a public web frontend, but version two does provide full access to any IO-Home compatible devices not limited to Velux and includes many different features.

| Firmware revision | Release date | Description                                                             |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.1.1.0.41.0      | 2016-06-01   | Default factory shipping revision.                                      |
| 0.1.1.0.42.0      | 2017-07-01   | Public Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.                                        |
| 0.1.1.0.44.0      | 2017-12-14   | Public Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.                                        |
| 2.0.0.71	        | 2018-09-27   | Public SLIP-API w/ private-only WLAN-based Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.    |

Notes:

- Velux bridges cannot be returned to version one of the firmware after being upgraded to version two.
- Firmware updates are currently provided at [Velux download area](https://updates2.velux.com/).


## Is it possible to run the both communication methods in parallel?

For environments with the firmware version 0.1.* on the gateway, the interaction with the bridge is limited to the HTTP/JSON based communication, of course. On the other hand, after upgrading the gateway firmware to version 2, it is possible to run the binding either using HTTP/JSON if there is a permanent connectivity towards the WLAN interface of the KLF200 or using SLIP towards the LAN interface of the gateway. For example the Raspberry PI can directly be connected via WLAN to the Velux gateway and providing the other services via the LAN interface (but not vice versa).


## Known Limitations

The communication based on HTTP/JSON is limited to one connection: If the binding is operational, you won't get access to the Web Frontend in parallel.

The SLIP communication is limited to two connections in parallel, i.e. two different openHAB bindings - or - one openHAB binding and another platform connection.

Both interfacing methods, HTTP/JSON and SLIP, can be run in parallel. Therefore, on the one hand you can use the Web Frontend for manual control and on the other hand a binding can do all automatic jobs.


## Unknown Velux devices

All known <B>Velux</B> devices can be handled by this binding. However, there might be some new ones which will be reported within the logfiles. Therefore, error messages like the one below should be reported to the maintainers so that the new Velux device type can be incorporated."
